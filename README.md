# Binance-Smart-Chain--Bike-Rental-App

This is on the binance smart chain.

We have a bike rental facility.
When a customer comes to rent the bike, they do the transaction on the blockchain, ride it around, and bring it back.
Then we check out, through the blockchain transaction, how much time the customer rode the bike.
We calculate through the blockchain transaction if we have to charge the customer some extra money for overriding.
This payment customer does to us is done via the customer's credit account, which is, of course, the meta mask wallet.

Components of the project:

1. Smart contract
2. REact front end
3. Metamask wallet

Front-end components:

1. Sign in
(Connect to meta mask wallet)

Customer's Dashboard-
A. Current credit in the customer's account
B. Current bike's due amount to be paid
C. Current bike's ride minutes remaining
D. STatus: Green- I have a bike checked on(Taken)/Red- I don't have a bike checked on(NOt taken)

2. Choose the bike

3. Checkout

We access a renter through it's wallet address, because everthing on web3 is a wallet address.
